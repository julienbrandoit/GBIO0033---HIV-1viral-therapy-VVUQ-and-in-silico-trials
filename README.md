# HIV Viral Therapy In Silico Study

This repository contains the code and analysis related to the in silico study of a viral therapy model for HIV-1, as presented in the report for the course **GBIO0033 - Advances in In Silico Medicine**.

## Overview

The study investigates a mathematical model describing the interaction between HIV-1, host cells, and a genetically modified therapeutic virus. Using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the model simulates the effect of viral therapy in reducing HIV-1 load and restoring host cell populations. 

Key analyses include:
- **Reproduction of model dynamics**: Single and double infection scenarios.
- **Equilibrium and sensitivity analysis**: Exploration of parameter influence on treatment efficacy.
- **In silico clinical trials**: Simulation of virtual patient populations to assess treatment response variability.
